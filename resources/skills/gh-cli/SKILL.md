description: Use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PRs, reviews, issues, releases, and Actions/CI runs — reading review threads, posting reviews, fetching failed run logs, triaging checks. Prefer `gh` over web URLs.

# gh CLI

`gh` is the canonical interface for GitHub. Prefer it over scraping web URLs or guessing API paths. Discover flags with `gh <cmd> --help` rather than enumerating here.

Auth: `gh auth status`. If logged out, ask the user to run `gh auth login`.

Repo: inferred from cwd. Pass `-R OWNER/REPO` when outside the repo.

Consent: posting reviews/comments, merging, releasing, and any `gh api` write are external actions — explicit user approval first; read-only `gh` commands are fine.

Output: `gh run view --log` and `--paginate` on large result sets are huge — default to `--log-failed`, cap with `--jq`/`--limit`, and pipe through `tail -N`. For big PR diffs, list changed paths first (`gh pr diff <N> --name-only`), then read targeted files.

## PR review — non-obvious bits

Find PRs awaiting your review: `gh pr list --search "review-requested:@me"`.

Existing review state — two endpoints, easy to confuse:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/123/comments  --paginate   # inline, line-anchored
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues/123/comments --paginate   # PR-level conversation
```

Post inline comments in one review (line-anchored, multi-comment) — no `gh pr review` flag for this; use the API:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/123/reviews -f event=COMMENT \
  -f body="overall notes" \
  -F 'comments[][path]=src/foo.py' -F 'comments[][line]=42' \
  -F 'comments[][body]=this is wrong because…'
```

Resolve a review thread (GraphQL):
```bash
gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}){thread{isResolved}}}' -F id=THREAD_NODE_ID
```

Reply to a specific inline thread:
```bash
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/123/comments/COMMENT_ID/replies -f body="fixed in abc1234"
```

Top-level review verbs: `gh pr review <N> --approve|--request-changes|--comment -b "…"` — posting a review is an external action; get explicit user approval first.

## Workflow runs

Default to **failed-only** logs, never the full log:
```bash
gh run view 123456 --log-failed          # preferred
gh run view 123456 --log | tail -200     # only if --log-failed isn't enough
```

Find the run behind a PR's latest push: `gh pr checks 123 --json name,state,link,workflow`.

## `gh api` cheatsheet

- `-f key=val` — string param
- `-F key=val` — typed (numbers, booleans, `@file`)
- `-X METHOD` — HTTP verb
- `--jq '.field'` — filter response
- `--paginate` — follow `Link` headers
